  # For distributed computing in tar_make(), supply a {crew} controller
  # as discussed at https://books.ropensci.org/targets/crew.html.
  # Choose a controller that suits your needs. For example, the following
  # sets a controller with 2 workers which will run as local R processes:
  #
  #   controller = crew::crew_controller_local(workers = 2)
  #
  # Alternatively, if you want workers to run on a high-performance computing
  # cluster, select a controller from the {crew.cluster} package. The following
  # example is a controller for Sun Grid Engine (SGE).
  #
  #   controller = crew.cluster::crew_controller_sge(
  #     workers = 50,
  #     # Many clusters install R as an environment module, and you can load it
  #     # with the script_lines argument. To select a specific verison of R,
  #     # you may need to include a version string, e.g. "module load R/4.3.0".
  #     # Check with your system administrator if you are unsure.
  #     script_lines = "module load R"
  #   )
  #
  # Set other options as needed.
